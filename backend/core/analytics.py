"""Opt-in product analytics — hardened.

OmniVoice is local-first, so analytics here is held to a higher bar than the
usual SDK drop-in. Three rules, each enforced in code below and pinned by tests:

1. **Off unless the user says yes.** Two independent gates must BOTH be true:
   a build-provided ``POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN`` *and* the user's explicit
   ``analytics_enabled`` preference, which defaults to **False**. A default
   install transmits nothing, so the product's promise holds out of the box.
   ``OMNIVOICE_ANALYTICS_DISABLED=1`` is a hard kill switch that outranks both.

2. **No exception autocapture, ever.** The obvious SDK default
   (``enable_exception_autocapture=True``) ships raw tracebacks — which carry
   absolute paths (``/Users/<name>/…``), and in this codebase can carry Hugging
   Face tokens and model paths straight out of exception messages. That would
   bypass ``core.failure.sanitize()``, the redaction this project already runs on
   every error surface. It is explicitly disabled.

3. **Metadata only, enforced by allowlist.** Every event property is filtered
   through ``_ALLOWED_PROPS``. A key that isn't on the list is *dropped*, not
   trusted — so no future caller can leak the text of a take, a file path, or a
   voice name by adding a field. Counts, durations, ids of *engines* (not users),
   and booleans are all that can get through.

The person id is a random UUID minted per installation. It is not derived from
hardware, hostname, username, or anything else identifying — it exists only to
tell "same install" from "different install".
