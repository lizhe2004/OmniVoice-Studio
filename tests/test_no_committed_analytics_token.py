"""No analytics token may be committed to the repo.

gitleaks caught a hardcoded PostHog key in frontend/src/utils/analytics.ts once.
PostHog client tokens are *publishable* (write-only event ingestion, not data
access), so it was never a credential leak — but a token-shaped literal in the
source is a bad habit, and this project already bans them. The destination is
supplied at BUILD time instead (VITE_POSTHOG_KEY / POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN).

This guard makes the rule ours rather than relying on the scanner to catch it,
and it fails BEFORE a push rather than after. Same file-scanning idiom as
test_no_hardcoded_cjk / test_no_literal_borders.
